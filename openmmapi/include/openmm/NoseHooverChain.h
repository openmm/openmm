/**
 * This class defines a chain of Nose-Hoover particles to be used as a heat bath to
 * scale the velocities of a collection of particles subject to thermostating.  The
 * heat bath is propagated using the multi time step approach detailed in
 *
 * G. J. Martyna, M. E. Tuckerman, D. J. Tobias and M. L. Klein, Mol. Phys. 87, 1117 (1996).
 *
 * where the total number of timesteps used to propagate the chain in each step is
 * the number of MTS steps multiplied by the number of terms in the Yoshida-Suzuki decomposition.
 *
 * Two types of NHC may be created.  The first is a simple thermostat that couples with a given subset
 * of the atoms within a system, controling their absolute motion.  The second is more elaborate and
 * can thermostat tethered pairs of atoms and in this case two thermostats are created: one that controls
 * the absolute center of mass velocity of each pair and another that controls their motion relative to
 * one another.
