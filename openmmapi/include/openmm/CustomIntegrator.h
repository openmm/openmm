/**
 * This is an Integrator that can be used to implemented arbitrary, user defined
 * integration algorithms.  It is flexible enough to support a wide range of
 * methods including both deterministic and stochastic integrators, Metropolized
 * integrators, and integrators that must integrate additional quantities along
 * with the particle positions and momenta.
 *
 * To create an integration algorithm, you first define a set of variables the
 * integrator will compute.  Variables come in two types: global variables
 * have a single value, while per-DOF variables have a value for every
 * degree of freedom (x, y, or z coordinate of a particle).  You can define as
 * many variables as you want of each type.  The value of any variable can be
 * computed by the integration algorithm, or set directly by calling a method on
 * the CustomIntegrator.  All variables are persistent between integration
 * steps; once a value is set, it keeps that value until it is changed by the
 * user or recomputed in a later integration step.
 *
 * Next, you define the algorithm as a series of computations.  To execute a
 * time step, the integrator performs the list of computations in order.  Each
 * computation updates the value of one global or per-DOF value.  There are
 * several types of computations that can be done:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Global: You provide a mathematical expression involving only global
 * variables.  It is evaluated and stored into a global variable.</li>
 * <li>Per-DOF: You provide a mathematical expression involving both global and
 * per-DOF variables.  It is evaluated once for every degree of freedom, and
 * the values are stored into a per-DOF variable.</li>
 * <li>Sum: You provide a mathematical expression involving both global and
 * per-DOF variables.  It is evaluated once for every degree of freedom.  All
 * of those values are then added together, and the sum is stored into a global
 * variable.</li>
 * <li>Constrain Positions: The particle positions are updated so that all
 * distance constraints are satisfied.</li>
 * <li>Constrain Velocities: The particle velocities are updated so the net
 * velocity along any constrained distance is 0.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Like all integrators, CustomIntegrator ignores any particle whose mass is 0.
 * It is skipped when doing per-DOF computations, and is not included when
 * computing sums over degrees of freedom.
 *
 * In addition to the variables you define by calling addGlobalVariable() and
 * addPerDofVariable(), the integrator provides the following pre-defined
 * variables:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>dt: (global) This is the step size being used by the integrator.</li>
 * <li>energy: (global, read-only) This is the current potential energy of the
 * system.</li>
 * <li>energy0, energy1, energy2, ...: (global, read-only) This is similar to
 * energy, but includes only the contribution from forces in one force group.
 * A single computation step may only depend on a single energy variable
 * (energy, energy0, energy1, etc.).</li>
 * <li>x: (per-DOF) This is the current value of the degree of freedom (the x,
 * y, or z coordinate of a particle).</li>
 * <li>v: (per-DOF) This is the current velocity associated with the degree of
 * freedom (the x, y, or z component of a particle's velocity).</li>
 * <li>f: (per-DOF, read-only) This is the current force acting on the degree of
 * freedom (the x, y, or z component of the force on a particle).</li>
 * <li>f0, f1, f2, ...: (per-DOF, read-only) This is similar to f, but includes
 * only the contribution from forces in one force group.  A single computation
 * step may only depend on a single force variable (f, f0, f1, etc.).</li>
 * <li>m: (per-DOF, read-only) This is the mass of the particle the degree of
 * freedom is associated with.</li>
 * <li>uniform: (either global or per-DOF, read-only) This is a uniformly
 * distributed random number between 0 and 1.  Every time an expression is
 * evaluated, a different value will be used.  When used in a per-DOF
 * expression, a different value will be used for every degree of freedom.
 * Note, however, that if this variable appears multiple times in a single
 * expression, the same value is used everywhere it appears in that
 * expression.</li>
 * <li>gaussian: (either global or per-DOF, read-only) This is a Gaussian
 * distributed random number with mean 0 and variance 1.  Every time an expression
 * is evaluated, a different value will be used.  When used in a per-DOF
 * expression, a different value will be used for every degree of freedom.
 * Note, however, that if this variable appears multiple times in a single
 * expression, the same value is used everywhere it appears in that
 * expression.</li>
 * <li>A global variable is created for every adjustable parameter defined
 * in the integrator's Context.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The following example uses a CustomIntegrator to implement a velocity Verlet
 * integrator:
 *
 * <tt><pre>
 * CustomIntegrator integrator(0.001);
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f/m");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x+dt*v");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f/m");
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * The first step updates the velocities based on the current forces.
 * The second step updates the positions based on the new velocities, and the
 * third step updates the velocities again.  Although the first and third steps
 * look identical, the forces used in them are different.  You do not need to
 * tell the integrator that; it will recognize that the positions have changed
 * and know to recompute the forces automatically.
 *
 * The above example has two problems.  First, it does not respect distance
 * constraints.  To make the integrator work with constraints, you need to add
 * extra steps to tell it when and how to apply them.  Second, it never gives
 * Forces an opportunity to update the context state.  This should be done every
 * time step so that, for example, an AndersenThermostat can randomize velocities
 * or a MonteCarloBarostat can scale particle positions.  You need to add a
 * step to tell the integrator when to do this.  The following example corrects
 * both these problems, using the RATTLE algorithm to apply constraints:
 *
 * <tt><pre>
 * CustomIntegrator integrator(0.001);
 * integrator.addPerDofVariable("x1", 0);
 * integrator.addUpdateContextState();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f/m");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x+dt*v");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x1", "x");
 * integrator.addConstrainPositions();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f/m+(x-x1)/dt");
 * integrator.addConstrainVelocities();
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * CustomIntegrator can be used to implement multiple time step integrators.  The
 * following example shows an r-RESPA integrator.  It assumes the quickly changing
 * forces are in force group 0 and the slowly changing ones are in force group 1.
 * It evaluates the "fast" forces four times as often as the "slow" forces.
 *
 * <tt><pre>
 * CustomIntegrator integrator(0.004);
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f1/m");
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
 *     integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*(dt/4)*f0/m");
 *     integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x+(dt/4)*v");
 *     integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*(dt/4)*f0/m");
 * }
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+0.5*dt*f1/m");
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * The sequence of computations in a CustomIntegrator can include flow control in
 * the form of "if" and "while" blocks.  The computations inside an "if" block
 * are executed either zero or one times, depending on whether a condition is
 * true.  The computations inside a "while" block are executed repeatedly for as
 * long as the condition remains true.  Be very careful when writing "while"
 * blocks; there is nothing to stop you from creating an infinite loop!
 *
 * For example, suppose you are writing a Monte Carlo algorithm.  Assume you have
 * already computed a new set of particle coordinates "xnew" and a step acceptance
 * probability "acceptanceProbability".  The following lines use an "if" block
 * to decide whether to accept the step, and if it is accepted, store the new
 * positions into "x".
 *
 * <tt><pre>
 * integrator.beginIfBlock("uniform < acceptanceProbability");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "xnew");
 * integrator.endBlock();
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * The condition in an "if" or "while" block is evaluated globally, so it may
 * only involve global variables, not per-DOF ones.  It may use any of the
 * following comparison operators: =, <. >, !=, <=, >=.  Blocks may be nested
 * inside each other.
 * 
 * "Per-DOF" computations can also be thought of as per-particle computations
 * that operate on three component vectors.  For example, "x+dt*v" means to take
 * the particle's velocity (a vector), multiply it by the step size, and add the
 * position (also a vector).  The result is a new vector that can be stored into
 * a per-DOF variable with addComputePerDof(), or it can be summed over all
 * components of all particles with addComputeSum().  Because the calculation is
 * done on vectors, you can use functions that operate explicitly on vectors
 * rather than just computing each component independently.  For example, the
 * following line uses a cross product to compute the angular momentum of each
 * particle and stores it into a per-DOF variable.
 * 
 * <tt><pre>
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("angularMomentum", "m*cross(x, v)");
 * </pre></tt>
 * 
 * Here are two more examples that may be useful as starting points for writing
 * your own integrators.  The first one implements the algorithm used by the
 * standard VerletIntegrator class.  This is a leapfrog algorithm, in contrast
 * to the velocity Verlet algorithm shown above, so it only requires applying
 * constraints once in each time step.
 * 
 * <tt><pre>
 * CustomIntegrator integrator(dt);
 * integrator.addPerDofVariable("x0", 0);
 * integrator.addUpdateContextState();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x0", "x");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v+dt*f/m");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x+dt*v");
 * integrator.addConstrainPositions();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "(x-x0)/dt");
 * </pre></tt>
 * 
 * The second one implements the algorithm used by the standard
 * LangevinMiddleIntegrator class.  kB is Boltzmann's constant.
 * 
 * <tt><pre>
 * CustomIntegrator integrator(dt);
 * integrator.addGlobalVariable("a", exp(-friction*dt));
 * integrator.addGlobalVariable("b", sqrt(1-exp(-2*friction*dt)));
 * integrator.addGlobalVariable("kT", kB*temperature);
 * integrator.addPerDofVariable("x1", 0);
 * integrator.addUpdateContextState();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v + dt*f/m");
 * integrator.addConstrainVelocities();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x + 0.5*dt*v");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "a*v + b*sqrt(kT/m)*gaussian");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x", "x + 0.5*dt*v");
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("x1", "x");
 * integrator.addConstrainPositions();
 * integrator.addComputePerDof("v", "v + (x-x1)/dt");
 * </pre></tt>
 * 
 * Another feature of CustomIntegrator is that it can use derivatives of the
 * potential energy with respect to context parameters.  These derivatives are
 * typically computed by custom forces, and are only computed if a Force object
 * has been specifically told to compute them by calling addEnergyParameterDerivative()
 * on it.  CustomIntegrator provides a deriv() function for accessing these
 * derivatives in global or per-DOF expressions.  For example, "deriv(energy, lambda)"
 * is the derivative of the total potentially energy with respect to the parameter
 * lambda.  You can also restrict it to a single force group by specifying a different
 * variable for the first argument, such as "deriv(energy1, lambda)".
 *
 * An Integrator has one other job in addition to evolving the equations of motion:
 * it defines how to compute the kinetic energy of the system.  Depending on the
 * integration method used, simply summing (mv^2)/2 over all degrees of
 * freedom may not give the correct answer.  For example, in a leapfrog integrator
 * the velocities are "delayed" by half a time step, so the above formula would
 * give the kinetic energy half a time step ago, not at the current time.
 *
 * Call setKineticEnergyExpression() to set an expression for the kinetic energy.
 * It is computed for every degree of freedom (excluding ones whose mass is 0) and
 * the result is summed.  The default expression is "m*v*v/2", which is correct
 * for many integrators.
 *
 * As example, the following line defines the correct way to compute kinetic energy
 * when using a leapfrog algorithm:
 *
 * <tt><pre>
 * integrator.setKineticEnergyExpression("m*v1*v1/2; v1=v+0.5*dt*f/m");
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * The kinetic energy expression may depend on the following pre-defined variables:
 * x, v, f, m, dt.  It also may depend on user-defined global and per-DOF variables,
 * and on the values of adjustable parameters defined  in the integrator's Context.
 * It may not depend on any other variable, such as the potential energy,
 * the force from a single force group, or a random number.
 *
 * Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following
 * functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select.  All trigonometric functions
 * are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm.  step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise.  delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise.
 * select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.  An expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using ";" as a separator.
 * 
 * Expressions used in ComputePerDof and ComputeSum steps can also use the following
 * functions that operate on vectors: cross(a, b) is the cross product of two
 * vectors; dot(a, b) is the dot product of two vectors; _x(a), _y(a), and _z(a)
 * extract a single component from a vector; and vector(a, b, c) creates a new
 * vector with the x component of the first argument, the y component of the
 * second argument, and the z component of the third argument.  Remember that every
 * quantity appearing in a vector expression is a vector.  Functions that appear
 * to return a scalar really return a vector whose components are all the same.
 * For example, _z(a) returns the vector (a.z, a.z, a.z).  Likewise, wherever a
 * constant appears in the expression, it really means a vector whose components
 * all have the same value.
 *
 * In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values.  You specify the function by
 * creating a TabulatedFunction object.  That function can then appear in expressions.
