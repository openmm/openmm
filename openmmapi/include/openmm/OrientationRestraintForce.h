/**
 * This is an approximately harmonic restraint force for keeping a group of particles
 * in a particular orientation.  You specify a set of particles and reference positions
 * for them.  It finds the rigid transformation that optimally aligns the particles
 * to the reference positions, consisting of a translation followed by a rotation.
 * The interaction energy is 2*k*sin^2(theta/2), where theta is the rotation angle
 * and k is a user defined force constant.  When the particles are close to the target
 * orientation, this approximately equals the harmonic form (k/2)*theta^2.  For larger
 * angles, the force is reduced from the harmonic form, and it goes to zero at theta=pi/2.
 * This avoids the discontinuity in the force that would be present if the force were
 * nonzero at pi/2.
