/**
 * This class implements nonbonded interactions between particles, including a Coulomb force to represent
 * electrostatics and a Lennard-Jones force to represent van der Waals interactions.  It optionally supports
 * periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions.  Lennard-Jones interactions are
 * calculated with the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule: it uses the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the
 * geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles.
 *
 * To use this class, create a NonbondedForce object, then call addParticle() once for each particle in the
 * System to define its parameters.  The number of particles for which you define nonbonded parameters must
 * be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you
 * try to create a Context.  After a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters
 * by calling setParticleParameters().  This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you
 * call updateParametersInContext().
 *
 * NonbondedForce also lets you specify "exceptions", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be
 * computed based on different parameters than those defined for the individual particles.  This can be used to
 * completely exclude certain interactions from the force calculation, or to alter how they interact with each other.
 *
 * Many molecular force fields omit Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions between particles separated by one
 * or two bonds, while using modified parameters for those separated by three bonds (known as "1-4 interactions").
 * This class provides a convenience method for this case called createExceptionsFromBonds().  You pass to it
 * a list of bonds and the scale factors to use for 1-4 interactions.  It identifies all pairs of particles which
 * are separated by 1, 2, or 3 bonds, then automatically creates exceptions for them.
 *
 * When using a cutoff, by default Lennard-Jones interactions are sharply truncated at the cutoff distance.
 * Optionally you can instead use a switching function to make the interaction smoothly go to zero over a finite
 * distance range.  To enable this, call setUseSwitchingFunction().  You must also call setSwitchingDistance()
 * to specify the distance at which the interaction should begin to decrease.  The switching distance must be
 * less than the cutoff distance.
 *
 * Another optional feature of this class (enabled by default) is to add a contribution to the energy which approximates
 * the effect of all Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the cutoff in a periodic system.  When running a simulation
 * at constant pressure, this can improve the quality of the result.  Call setUseDispersionCorrection() to set whether
 * this should be used.
 * 
 * In some applications, it is useful to be able to inexpensively change the parameters of small groups of particles.
 * Usually this is done to interpolate between two sets of parameters.  For example, a titratable group might have
 * two states it can exist in, each described by a different set of parameters for the atoms that make up the
 * group.  You might then want to smoothly interpolate between the two states.  This is done by first calling
 * addGlobalParameter() to define a Context parameter, then addParticleParameterOffset() to create a "parameter offset"
 * that depends on the Context parameter.  Each offset defines the following:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A Context parameter used to interpolate between the states.</li>
 * <li>A single particle whose parameters are influenced by the Context parameter.</li>
 * <li>Three scale factors (chargeScale, sigmaScale, and epsilonScale) that specify how the Context parameter
 * affects the particle.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The "effective" parameters for a particle (those used to compute forces) are given by
 * 
 * <tt><pre>
 * charge = baseCharge + param*chargeScale
 * sigma = baseSigma + param*sigmaScale
 * epsilon = baseEpsilon + param*epsilonScale
 * </pre></tt>
 * 
 * where the "base" values are the ones specified by addParticle() and "oaram" is the current value
 * of the Context parameter.  A single Context parameter can apply offsets to multiple particles,
 * and multiple parameters can be used to apply offsets to the same particle.  Parameters can also be used
 * to modify exceptions in exactly the same way by calling addExceptionParameterOffset().
