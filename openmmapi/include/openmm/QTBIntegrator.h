/**
 * This integrator implements the Adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath (adQTB) algorithm
 * as described in https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01164.  This is a fast method
 * for approximating nuclear quantum effects by applying a Langevin thermostat whose
 * random force varies with frequency to match the expected energy of a quantum
 * harmonic oscillator.
 * 
 * To compensate for zero point energy leakage, the spectrum of the random force
 * is adjusted automatically.  The trajectory is divided into short segments.  At
 * the end of each segment, the distribution of energy across frequencies is evaluated,
 * and the friction coefficients used in generating the random force are adjusted
 * to better match the target distribution.  You can monitor this process by calling
 * getAdaptedFriction().  It is important to equilibrate the simulation long enough
 * for the friction coefficients to converge before beginning the production part of
 * the simulation.
 * 
 * To make this process more robust, it is recommended to average the data over all
 * particles that are expected to behave identically.  To do this, you can optionally
 * call setParticleType() to define a particle as having a particular type.  The
 * data for all particles of the same type is averaged and they are adjusted together.
 * You also can set a different adaptation rate for each particle type.  The more
 * particles that are being averaged over, the higher the adaptation rate can reasonably
 * be set, leading to faster adaptation.
 * 
 * Most properties of this integrator are fixed at Context creation time and can
 * only be changed after that by reinitializing the Context.  That includes the
 * step size, friction coefficient, segment length, cutoff frequency, particle types,
 * and adaptation rates.  The only property of the integrator that can be freely
 * changed in the middle of a simulation is the temperature, and even that requires
 * some care.  The new temperature will not take effect until the beginning of the
 * next segment.  Furthermore, changing the temperature is a potentially expensive
 * operation, since it requires performing a calculation whose cost scales as the
 * cube of the number of time steps in a segment.
 * 
 * One must be very careful when trying to compute velocity dependent thermodynamic
 * quantities, such as the instantaneous temperature or instantaneous pressure.
 * The standard calculations for these quantities assume the velocities follow a
 * classical distribution.  They do not produce correct results for an adQTB
 * simulation, in which the velocities follow a quantum distribution.
