To write a useful bug report, please include as much detail as possible. Describe exactly what you are doing, what you expect to happen, and what is happening instead. If possible, provide a complete test case that can be used to reproduce the problem including a complete, self-contained script and all necessary input files. It is very difficult to fix a bug if we cannot reproduce it. Also include all of the following information.

- How you installed OpenMM (pip, conda, compile from source, etc.).
- The operating system and hardware (e.g. GPU model) you are using.
- The platform (CUDA, OpenCL, etc.) you are using.
- Any other software (Python libraries, setup tools, etc.) you are using along with OpenMM to implement your workflow.
- The output of the command `python -m openmm.testInstallation`.  It reports details about your installation and checks for some basic problems.
