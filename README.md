## OpenMM: A High Performance Molecular Dynamics Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pandegroup/openmm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pandegroup/openmm)

Introduction
------------

[OpenMM](https://simtk.org/home/openmm) is a toolkit for molecular simulation. It can be used either as a stand-alone application for running simulations, or as a library you call from your own code. It
provides a combination of extreme flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high performance (especially on recent GPUs) that make it truly unique among simulation codes.
