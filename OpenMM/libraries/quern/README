Quern 0.9 (beta)

Public domain code for sparse up-looking Givens QR, including incomplete
drop tolerance version for preconditioning iterative solvers.

Edit Makefile to fit your set up (in particular, MATLAB-specific stuff).
Currently it's set up for debugging; change the flags to get optimized
versions of the code.

In addition to the library libquern.a (with header quern.h), there are
two mex files (quern_internal_mex and quern_cgnr_mex) as well as a
stand-alone executable test_mat for running tests on matrices stored
in .mat files.
