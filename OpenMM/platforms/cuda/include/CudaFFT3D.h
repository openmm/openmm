 * This class performs three dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms.  It is based on the

 * Takahashi, D. and Kanada, Y., "High-Performance Radix-2, 3 and 5 Parallel 1-D Complex
 * FFT Algorithms for Distributed-Memory Parallel Computers."  Journal of Supercomputing,
 * 15, 207–228 (2000).
 * <p>
 * This class places certain restrictions on the allowed dimensions of the grid.  First,
 * the size of each dimension may have no prime factors other than 2, 3, 5, and 7.  You
 * can call findLegalDimension() to determine the smallest size that satisfies this
 * requirement and is greater than or equal to a specified minimum size.  Second, the size
 * of each dimension must be small enough to compute each 1D transform entirely in local
 * memory with one work unit per data point.  This will vary between platforms, but is
 * typically at least 512.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class performs an unnormalized transform.  That means that if you perform
 * a forward transform followed immediately by an inverse transform, the effect is to
 * multiply every value of the original data set by the total number of data points.
