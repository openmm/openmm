/**
 * This is a VirtualSite that uses the locations of three other particles to compute a local
 * coordinate system, then places the virtual site at a fixed location in that coordinate
 * system.  The origin of the coordinate system and the directions of its x and y axes
 * are each specified as a weighted sum of the locations of the three particles:
 * 
 * origin = w<sup>o</sup><sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> +  w<sup>o</sup><sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub> +  w<sup>o</sup><sub>3</sub>r<sub>3</sub>

 * ydir = w<sup>y</sup><sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> +  w<sup>y</sup><sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub> +  w<sup>y</sup><sub>3</sub>r<sub>3</sub>

 * For the origin, the three weights must add to one.  For example if
 * (w<sup>o</sup><sub>1</sub>, w<sup>o</sup><sub>2</sub>, w<sup>o</sup><sub>3</sub>) = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
 * the origin of the local coordinate system is at the location of particle 1.  For xdir and ydir,
 * the weights must add to zero.  For excample, if
 * (w<sup>x</sup><sub>1</sub>, w<sup>x</sup><sub>2</sub>, w<sup>x</sup><sub>3</sub>) = (-1.0, 0.5, 0.5),
 * the x axis points from particle 1 toward the midpoint between particles 2 and 3.
 * 
 * The z direction is computed as zdir = xdir x ydir.  To ensure the axes are all orthogonal,
 * ydir is then recomputed as ydir = zdir x xdir.  All three axis vectors are then normalized, and
 * the virtual site location is set to
 * 
 * origin + x*xdir + y*ydir + z*zdir
