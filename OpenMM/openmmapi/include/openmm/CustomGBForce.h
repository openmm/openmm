/**
 * This class implements complex, multiple stage nonbonded interactions between particles.  It is designed primarily
 * for implementing Generalized Born implicit solvation models, although it is not strictly limited to that purpose.
 * The interaction is specified as a series of computations, each defined by an arbitrary algebraic expression.
 * It also allows tabulated functions to be defined and used with the computations.  It optionally supports periodic boundary
 * conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions.
 *
 * The computation consists of calculating some number of per-particle <i>computed values</i>, followed by one or more
 * <i>energy terms</i>.  A computed value is a scalar value that is computed for each particle in the system.  It may
 * depend on an arbitrary set of global and per-particle parameters, and well as on other computed values that have
 * been calculated before it.  Once all computed values have been calculated, the energy terms and their derivatives
 * are evaluated to determine the system energy and particle forces.  The energy terms may depend on global parameters,
 * per-particle parameters, and per-particle computed values.
 *
 * When specifying a computed value or energy term, you provide an algebraic expression to evaluate and a <i>computation type</i>
 * describing how the expression is to be evaluated.  There are two main types of computations:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Single Particle</b>: The expression is evaluated once for each particle in the System.  In the case of a computed
 * value, this means the value for a particle depends only on other properties of that particle (its position, parameters, and other
 * computed values).  In the case of an energy term, it means each particle makes an independent contribution to the System
 * energy.</li>
 * <li><b>Particle Pairs</b>: The expression is evaluated for every pair of particles in the system.  In the case of a computed
 * value, the value for a particular particle is calculated by pairing it with every other particle in the system, evaluating
 * the expression for each pair, and summing them.  For an energy term, each particle pair makes an independent contribution to
 * the System energy.  (Note that energy terms are assumed to be symmetric with respect to the two interacting particles, and
 * therefore are evaluated only once per pair.  In contrast, expressions for computed values need not be symmetric and therefore are calculated
 * twice for each pair: once when calculating the value for the first particle, and again when calculating the value for the
 * second particle.)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Be aware that, although this class is extremely general in the computations it can define, particular Platforms may only support
 * more restricted types of computations.  In particular, all currently existing Platforms require that the first computed value
 * <i>must</i> be a particle pair computation, and all computed values after the first <i>must</i> be single particle computations.
 * This is sufficient for most Generalized Born models, but might not permit some other types of calculations to be implemented.
 *
 * This is a complicated class to use, and an example may help to clarify it.  The following code implements the OBC variant
 * of the GB/SA solvation model, using the ACE approximation to estimate surface area:
 *

 * CustomGBForce* custom = new CustomGBForce();

 *                               "U=r+sr2;"
 *                               "C=2*(1/or1-1/L)*step(sr2-r-or1);"
 *                               "L=max(or1, D);"
 *                               "D=abs(r-sr2);"
 *                               "sr2 = scale2*or2;"

 * custom->addComputedValue("B", "1/(1/or-tanh(1*psi-0.8*psi^2+4.85*psi^3)/radius);"
 *                               "psi=I*or; or=radius-0.009", CustomGBForce::SingleParticle);
 * custom->addEnergyTerm("28.3919551*(radius+0.14)^2*(radius/B)^6-0.5*138.935456*(1/soluteDielectric-1/solventDielectric)*q^2/B",
 *                       CustomGBForce::SingleParticle);
 * custom->addEnergyTerm("-138.935456*(1/soluteDielectric-1/solventDielectric)*q1*q2/f;"
 *                       "f=sqrt(r^2+B1*B2*exp(-r^2/(4*B1*B2)))", CustomGBForce::ParticlePair);
 * </pre></tt>
 *
 * It begins by defining three per-particle parameters (charge, atomic radius, and scale factor) and two global parameters
 * (the dielectric constants for the solute and solvent).  It then defines a computed value "I" of type ParticlePair.  The
 * expression for evaluating it is a complicated function of the distance between each pair of particles (r), their atomic
 * radii (radius1 and radius2), and their scale factors (scale1 and scale2).  Very roughly speaking, it is a measure of the
 * distance between each particle and other nearby particles.
 *
 * Next a computation is defined for the Born Radius (B).  It is computed independently for each particle, and is a function of
 * that particle's atomic radius and the intermediate value I defined above.
 *
 * Finally, two energy terms are defined.  The first one is computed for each particle and represents the surface area term,
 * as well as the self interaction part of the polarization energy.  The second term is calculated for each pair of particles,
 * and represents the screening of electrostatic interactions by the solvent.
 *
 * After defining the force as shown above, you should then call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to set the
 * values of its per-particle parameters (q, radius, and scale).  The number of particles for which you set parameters must be
 * exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context.
 * After a particle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setParticleParameters().  This will have no effect
 * on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().
 *
 * CustomGBForce also lets you specify "exclusions", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be
 * omitted from calculations.  This is most often used for particles that are bonded to each other.  Even if you specify exclusions,
 * however, you can use the computation type ParticlePairNoExclusions to indicate that exclusions should not be applied to a
 * particular piece of the computation.
 * 
 * This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters.
 * Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be
 * computed.  You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.
 *
 * Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following
 * functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select.  All trigonometric functions
 * are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm.  step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise.  delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise.
 * select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.  In expressions for particle pair calculations, the names of per-particle parameters and computed values
 * have the suffix "1" or "2" appended to them to indicate the values for the two interacting particles.  As seen in the above example,
 * an expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using ";" as a separator.
 *
 * In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values.  You specify the function by
 * creating a TabulatedFunction object.  That function can then appear in expressions.
