Introduction
############

OpenMM consists of two parts:

#. A set of libraries that lets programmers easily add molecular simulation
   features to their programs
#. An “application layer” that exposes those features to end users who just want
   to run simulations


This guide is divided into three sections:

* Part I (Chapters :ref:`the-openmm-application-layer-introduction`\ -\ :ref:`creating-force-fields`\ )
  describes the application layer.  It is relevant to all users, but especially relevant to people
  who want to use OpenMM as a stand-alone application for running simulations.
* Part II (Chapters :ref:`the-openmm-library-introduction`\ -\ :ref:`drude-plugin`\ )
  describes how to use the OpenMM libraries within your own applications.  It is primarily
  relevant to programmers who want to write simulation applications.
* Part III (Chapters :ref:`the-theory-behind-openmm-introduction`\ -\ :ref:`other-features`\ )
  describes the mathematical theory behind the features found in OpenMM.  It is relevant to all users.
