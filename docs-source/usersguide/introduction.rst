Introduction
############

OpenMM consists of two parts:

#. A set of libraries that lets programmers easily add molecular simulation
   features to their programs
#. An “application layer” that exposes those features to end users who just want
   to run simulations


This guide is divided into three sections:

* :ref:`Part I <the-openmm-application-layer>`
  describes the application layer.  It is relevant to all users, but especially relevant to people
  who want to use OpenMM as a stand-alone application for running simulations.
* :ref:`Part II <the-openmm-library>`
  describes how to use the OpenMM libraries within your own applications.  It is primarily
  relevant to programmers who want to write simulation applications.
* :ref:`Part III <the-theory-behind-openmm>`
  describes the mathematical theory behind the features found in OpenMM.  It is relevant to all users.
