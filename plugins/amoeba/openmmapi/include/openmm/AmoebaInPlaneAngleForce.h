 * quadratic term is set per-angle.  The coefficients of the higher order terms each have a single value that
 * is set globally.

 * To use it, create an AmoebaInPlaneAngleForce object then call addAngle() once for each angle.  After
 * an angle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setAngleParameters().
 * This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().
