 * This class implements all nonbonded interactions in the HIPPO force field: electrostatics,
 * induction, charge transfer, dispersion, and repulsion.  Although some of these are
 * conceptually distinct, they share parameters in common and are most efficiently computed
 * together.  For example, the same multipole definitions are used for both electrostatics
 * and Pauli repulsion.  Therefore, all of them are computed by a single Force object.
 *
 * To use it, create a HippoNonbondedForce object, then call addParticle() once for each particle.  After
 * an entry has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setParticleParameters().
 * This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().
 * 
 * You also can specify "exceptions", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be
 * reduced or completely omitted.  Call addException() to define exceptions.
