## How to Get Support for OpenMM

There are two main venues for getting support for OpenMM: the GitHub
[discussion forum](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/discussions) and the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/issues).  There is some overlap
between the two, but generally speaking the forum is for user oriented issues while the
issue tracker is for developer oriented issues.  If you have a question about how to use OpenMM
(including writing programs that access it through its public API), post on the forum.  If
you want to suggest a change to the code, or if you think you have found a bug,
open an issue.  The core developers monitor both, so don't worry if you aren't
sure which one is most appropriate for your question.  We will see it either way.

You also may want to consult the [documentation](https://docs.openmm.org/).  It is quite
thorough, and you may be able to find the answer to your question.
