/**
 * This class defines a uniform API for three dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms.
 * Each platform provides its own implementation.  Instances can be created by
 * calling createFFT() on a ComputeContext.
 *
 * FFTs tend to be most efficient when the size of each dimension is a product of
 * small prime factors.  You can call findLegalFFTDimension() on the ComputeContext
 * to determine the smallest size that satisfies this requirement and is greater
 * than or equal to a specified minimum size.
 *
 * Note that this class performs an unnormalized transform.  That means that if you perform
 * a forward transform followed immediately by an inverse transform, the effect is to
 * multiply every value of the original data set by the total number of data points.
