# Utilities for building OpenMM on a virtual machine

Building the VM with [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com):

* Make sure the latest [vagrant 1.6.3](http://vagrantup.com) is installed.
* Download the AMD APP SDK for Linux 64-bit `AMD-APP-SDK-v2.9-lnx64.tgz` from the [AMD APP SDK site](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/opencl-tools-sdks/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/) and place it in the current (shared) directory.
* Run `vagrant up` to bring up and configure the VM.
