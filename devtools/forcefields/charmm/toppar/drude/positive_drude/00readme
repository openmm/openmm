Temporary test case for the postitive drude models is
positive_drude_test_temp.inp due to bug related to "drude reset" and
"dele atom" that only effects energies etc. following deletion of all
atoms and drudes and generation of new atoms with drudes.  To run the
test case edit run_test.cmd to point to the charmm executable and then
source run_test.cmd.  Files in the data subdirectory will have the
energies for each complex.
