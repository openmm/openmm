class Metadynamics(object):
    """Performs metadynamics.

    This class implements well-tempered metadynamics, as described in Barducci et al.,
    "Well-Tempered Metadynamics: A Smoothly Converging and Tunable Free-Energy Method"
    (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.020603).  You specify from one to three
    collective variables whose sampling should be accelerated.  A biasing force that
    depends on the collective variables is added to the simulation.  Initially the bias
    is zero.  As the simulation runs, Gaussian bumps are periodically added to the bias
    at the current location of the simulation.  This pushes the simulation away from areas
    it has already explored, encouraging it to sample other regions.  At the end of the
    simulation, the bias function can be used to calculate the system's free energy as a
    function of the collective variables.

    To use the class you create a Metadynamics object, passing to it the System you want
    to simulate and a list of BiasVariable objects defining the collective variables.
    It creates a biasing force and adds it to the System.  You then run the simulation
    as usual, but call step() on the Metadynamics object instead of on the Simulation.

    You can optionally specify a directory on disk where the current bias function should
    periodically be written.  In addition, it loads biases from any other files in the
    same directory and includes them in the simulation.  It loads files when the
    Metqdynamics object is first created, and also checks for any new files every time it
    updates its own bias on disk.

    This serves two important functions.  First, it lets you stop a metadynamics run and
    resume it later.  When you begin the new simulation, it will load the biases computed
    in the earlier simulation and continue adding to them.  Second, it provides an easy
    way to parallelize metadynamics sampling across many computers.  Just point all of
    them to a shared directory on disk.  Each process will save its biases to that
    directory, and also load in and apply the biases added by other processes.
