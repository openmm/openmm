    """DebuggingReporter is a useful tool for debugging simulations that blow up
    after running for a while.  It records a checkpoint after every time step, keeping
    a list of the most recent ones in memory.  It also checks the positions,
    velocities, and forces to make sure they are still finite.  If it discovers that 
    anything has become NaN or infinite, it writes its saved checkpoints to disk and
    throws an exception to immediately end the simulation.  This allows you to
    inspect the behavior in the steps leading up to the error and retrace how it
    happened.

    To use this class, create a DebuggingReporter and add it to the Simulation's list of reporters.
